Ansible Challenge! Run the bash script first to start with clean containers. Feel free to paste the challenge details as a comment inside your playbook.

 

bash ~/px/scripts/full-setup.sh

 

Part 1: Move into or create a directory in mycode called "wednesday_challenge". In the challenge directory create a playbook called "wednesday_challenge02.yml". Set the hosts key to target planetexpress but exclude Farnsworth.

 

Part 2: Create a vars_prompt section that will ask the user a new name for a directory. Ask the user for confirmation for their answer and set a default answer to be "new_default". Feel free to include any other parameters.




Part 3: Make a task that will create a new directory on the target machines, using the name chosen by the user being prompted. Set the mode against the directory to include all permissions: read, write, and execute. Make sure the directory is created in "/home/date_info/"

 

Part 4: Make more tasks that will add a file to the new directory called "today.txt" containing today's date. Basically a timestamp (try running a date command on the CLI and using redirection).

 

Part 5: Trust but verify! Make a final task that show the results of the contents of the "today.txt" file.
